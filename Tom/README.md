## About

**SIMUnet_CLEW** is a project focused on incorporating low-energy observables into SIMUnet.  
Here we briefly describe what's going on in Tom's low-energy YAML files.

---

## Details

- **EFT_LO: SM**: *(The SM predictions have been normalised to 1)*
- **SM_fixed**: *(These numbers are experimental central values divided by their normalised SM predictions)*
- **theory_cov**: *(This is the theory-experimental-combined covariance matrix)*

---

## Exceptions

- **SIMU_MESON_2.yaml**: *(The SM predictions have **NOT** been normalised)*
